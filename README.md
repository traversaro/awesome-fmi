> A curated list of Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) libraries, tools and resources.

Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models.
See the [official FMI website](http://fmi-standard.org/) for the official specification and more information about the FMI standard.
